## 2024-12-19 - Unit Type Selector Removal from New Product 2

### **What Was Changed:**
- **Modified `trade/trade/tradeInput.php`**: Completely removed the unit type selector (MMBTU/Block/MWH/Bbls) from New Product 2 trades
- **Removed Unit Type Logic**: Eliminated all unitType variable initialization and related database queries
- **Simplified Display**: New Product 2 trades now use the standard `$tradeUnits` display like other trade types
- **Maintained `populateUnit()` Function**: Kept the function for location form use, but removed it from trade input

### **Technical Details:**
- **Removed Code**: Eliminated the entire conditional block that showed unit type selector for New Product 2
- **Removed Variables**: Eliminated `$unitType` variable initialization and related database queries
- **Simplified Logic**: New Product 2 trades now use the same unit display as standard trades
- **Function Preservation**: The `populateUnit()` function remains available for the location form dropdown

### **Why This Change:**
- **User Request**: User wanted to remove the ability to choose from a unit type list for Product Type 10 (New Product 2)
- **Simplification**: Eliminates complexity and potential confusion from having different unit handling for different product types
- **Consistency**: All trade types now use the same unit display mechanism
- **Maintenance**: Reduces code complexity and potential for bugs

- **Removed from REC**: The unit type selector no longer appears for "New Product 1" (now renamed to "REC")
- **Maintained for New Product 2**: The unit type selector continues to work for "New Product 2" trades

### **Technical Details:**
- **Previous Logic**: Used `IN ('New Product 1', 'New Product 2')` to show unit selector for both product types
- **New Logic**: Changed to `= 'New Product 2'` to show unit selector only for New Product 2
- **Dynamic Query**: Still dynamically queries the database to get the correct product type ID
- **Backward Compatibility**: REC trades now use the standard `$tradeUnits` display instead of the custom unit selector

### **Why This Change:**
- **User Request**: User renamed "New Product 1" to "REC" and wanted different behavior
- **REC Purpose**: REC trades don't need the MMBTU/Block/MWH/Bbls unit selector
- **New Product 2 Purpose**: New Product 2 will be used for something else later and keeps the unit selector
- **Cleaner Separation**: Each product type now has appropriate functionality for its intended use

### **Files Modified:**
1. `trade/trade/tradeInput.php` - Modified unit type selector logic to only show for New Product 2

### **Technical Details:**
- **Function Signature Change**: `populateOffsetList($offsetID)` → `populateOffsetList($offsetID, $tradeType = null)`
- **Logic Added**: Check if the current trade type is a "New Product" type and skip auto-selection of NYMEX Natural Gas for those types
- **Backward Compatibility**: All other trade types continue to work exactly as before

### **Why This Change:**
- User requested that Product Types 9 and 10 should default to "Select" in the Offset Index field
- Previously, these product types were auto-selecting "NYMEX Natural Gas (LD1)" which was not desired behavior
- This provides better user control and clearer indication that a selection is required

### **Files Modified:**
1. `trade/functions.php` - Updated `populateOffsetList()` function
2. `trade/trade/tradeInput.php` - Updated function call to pass trade type
